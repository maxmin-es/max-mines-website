			<div class="subtitle">Maps</div>

			For the final project for Brown’s Software Engineering course (CS32), I built a fully functional navigation application in Java. 
			The application allows users to specify a SQLite3 database file to load in custom map data sets. We used the databases available from <a href="openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>.
			Users can  interact with the map in one of two ways; they can either specify a latitude and longitude and are brought to the nearest intersection, or click/specify
			two points on the map and are shown the shortest path between the points.
			<br>
			<br>
			The project built on previous projects we’d worked on throughout the semester. The nearest intersection feature of the application used a previous K-D Tree
			implementation. The shortest path algorithm used a previous implmentation of A*. The autocompletion of streetnames when typing in the GUI used a previous implmentation of
			tries. Below I detail the different components of this project.

		<div class="subtitle">Preprocessing/Runtime Optimizations</div>
After starting the program, the user is prompted to enter a .sqlite3 database file. The file is fed to the self-made K-D Tree class which is used to quickly calculate
nearest distance measurements. We perform tile caching which allows for a smoother zoom/pan experience. Tile caching means that we make larger SQL queries for more map information than we are actually displaying.
 This allows us to load out-of-frame map information into memory so when the viewport changes, the new parts of the map are quick to load.
<br>
<br>

		<div class="subtitle">K-D Tree</div>
		One of the semesters earlier projects was Stars, a program that used a K-D Tree to execute finding the k-nearest neighbors of a given point in
		n-dimensional space, or finding all neighbors within a given radius of a point. You can read a full description of the K-D Tree datastructure  
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree">here</a>. I built my K-D Tree methods with 
		<a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generics-in-java/">Java Generics</a> which allowed me to reuse the code for the Maps project. I simply fed my
		K-D Tree class a series of Map Node objects which each have a .getCoordinates() method. 
		<br>
		<br>

		<br>
		A K-D Tree is a binary search tree with data of k dimensions. Each depth level of the tree represents a different 
		one of the k-dimensions of the data. In the case of map nodes, our vertex-splits alternated between longitude and latitude.
		When constructing the tree, we sort the data points on the axis that we want to split on. We then take the median point from that list,
		and recur on a left subtree using the data less than the median and a right subtree using the data greater than the median.
		The figure above provides a good visualization of the algorithm, where the red and the blue represent different dimensions of the data.
		<br>
		<br>
		The K-D Tree nearest neighbor algorithm works as follows:
		Given a node and a target point to search around...
		<ul>
			<li>Determine the straight-line distance from the current node to your target node. If the 
				current node is closer to the target than your current best, update the value accordingly.
			</li>
			<li>Determine the axis distance based on the corresponding depth-based dimension discussed above. For example,
				if we are on a longitude layer, we would measure the current node longitude to our target point. If
				the axis distance between this node and our target is less than or equal to the euclidean distance between our current
				best and our target, we recur on both children. We do this because it's possible that there are points closer to our target
				on the other side of the half space created by the current node.
			</li>
			<li>If we don't recur on both children, then we simply recur based on a comparison between the two relevant axis values 
				(if the longitude of the target is bigger than the current node, we go right, else left).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class="subtitle">A*</div>
		A* is the graph-traversal algorithm used to find the shortest distance between two points on the map. 
		As this algorithm is quite common and fairly similar to Dijkstra's, I won't describe A* in detail because you can quickly understand it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">here</a>. 

		<div class="subtitle">Tries, n-grams, and Autocomplete</div>
		Upon loading in the .sqlite3 file to the Maps program, a trie is constructed using all the street names in the database 
		A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">trie</a> is a search tree datastructure often used for lexical data.
		Tries are also known as prefix trees because each node represents an additional letter added onto the parent's value (see figure below).
		<br>
		<br>
		<img src="img/trie.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
		<br>
		<br>
		A few notes on my trie implementation: Each node on the tree has a hashmap with 26 entries pointing to child nodes (if they exist). For example, if the first
		node in the trie is 'a', the node might have a child value at 't' for the word 'at' but no child entry for 'y' because 
		there are no words in the corpus starting with 'ay'. Each node also had a boolean value representing whether the node
		constitues a word. For example, if we were to build the word 'apple', the letter 'a' by itself is a word, but 'ap', 'app', and 'appl' are not words.
		<br>
		<br>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a> is a metric for determining the distance between
		two strings. This metric was used to create a sort of "nearest neighbor" search for the trie. Thus, given a certain string, the trie could return
		all possible values that were within a given LD of the target.
		<br>
		<br>
		When a user types a street name, the program dynamically searches the trie and returns a list of words/street names within a given
		Levenshtein distance of the target. The autocomplete implementation also has options for loading in a corpus of text 
		to create bigram frequencies (how often two words cooccur), but this is less useful for streetnames, so by default this feature 
		is turned off in the Maps application.

		<div class="subtitle">Server and Client</div>
		Our backend was written entirely in Java and uses Spark to communicate with our JavaScript front end. Our front end makes requests from the backend for
		map data, fastest-route information, and autocorrect suggestsions. Our Java server 
		sends the front end packages of strees (edges) to draw. A simple division calculatation based on our current viewport allows us
		to paint the map on the screen. All painting is done with the HTML canvas library.

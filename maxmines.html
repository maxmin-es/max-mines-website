		<p>I'm a 4th-year at <a href="http://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> double-majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I'm interested in the intersection of these two fields,
			particularly language and music. I currently work in the <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/bltlab/">Language and Thought Lab</a> where we study children learn language. 
			I've spent my past summers working at <a href="https://www.sanalabs.com/">Sana Labs</a> in Stockholm doing product design for their speech pronunciation product, at <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/">Penn Engineering</a> 
			doing NLP research, and at <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/psych/infant/people.html">Penn Infant Language Center</a> doing child language acquisition research.
  
			  I was born and raised outside of Philadelphia, a city which I still very much consider home. I spend most of my free time playing, producing, talking about, or listening
			  to music. I like a lot of different stuff, but currently there are Stevie Wonder, Amy Winehouse, and MGMT posters hanging in my room, and a Feist album in my aux-less car.
			  You can listen to what I've been into lately <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4mRZBNbnQ4uWxuoC0Yo7Ek?si=-prrDAYxREecPC3iuJvv1w">here</a>.</p>
